NAME
        scoreboard - build radiator

DESCRIPTION
        Scoreboard is an application designed as an information radiator. It
        uses visual and audio feedback for maximum effect. It is designed to
        support multiple continuous integration servers. The application
        currently includes connectors for Hudson and Cruise Control.

        This version of scoreboard represents a new development direction for
        the original leapstream developed scoreboard.

USAGE
        T.B.A.

STATE
        The `scoreboard` application has a stable release based upon a
        scriptable (javascript) config. There is currently a development
        push to replace this with a more reliable mechanism. The new
        mechanism MAY provide a compatability layer to the current config
        style.
